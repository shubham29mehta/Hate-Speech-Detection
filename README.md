# Project Overview

The goal of this project/repository is to identify **Hate Speech** in a tweet using deep learning based Transfomer models. I have used pre-trained **ALBERT transfomer** and fine tuned it on the data to identify hate specch in a tweet.

# Data Source

You can get the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset. I have used a subset of data to train,validate and test the model.


# API

Using FastAPI, we'll create a web server that exposes a /predict route. Clients will post their translation request to the /predict and get the classification results.
